# VertexArmor-Enclosure
VertexArmor are my newest SlimeVR Cases with better charging port location, easier internal layout (toolless assembly) and a dock too! (Might require grabbing USB-C connectors from old/unused cables and some glue to secure them in place)

**Please note V2 is in the works and will only support my custom pcb which once ready will be published in a separate repo!**

### Component support (V1):
* BMI160 (BMI270 might work, untested)
* Wemos D1 Mini (both micro USB and USB-C should work, choose which one you like best)
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller)
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26 AWG wires (Thinner, 26 AWG, wires preferred for easier soldering/mounting)

**For connecting the components, please refer to the SlimeVR documentation** (https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html)

Made with Blender 3.6.1 / 4.0 (latest updates)

### Component support (V2):
* BMI160/BMI270
* Wemos D1 Mini (both micro USB and USB-C should work, choose which one you like best, I used USB-C variants)
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller)
* tp4056 (type C/micro usb) charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26 AWG wires (Thinner, 26 AWG, wires preferred for connecting power switch)
* JST or other type of headers for connecting the battery and board (I used JST connectors typically used in RC-models)
* pinheaders if your D1 didn't come with any (to connect it to the pcb)
