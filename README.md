# VertexArmor-Enclosure
VertexArmor are my newest SlimeVR Cases with better charging port location, easier internal layout (toolless assembly) and a dock too! (Might require grabbing USB-C connectors from old/unused cables and some glue to secure them in place)

**Please note the charger for the cases is currently unfinished!**

Component support:
* BMI160
* Wemos D1 Mini
* 804040 1800 mAh Battery (or smaller)
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26 AWG wires (Thinner, 26 AWG, wires preferred for easier soldering/mounting)

For connecting the components, please refer to the SlimeVR documentation (https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html)

Made with Blender 3.6.1 / 4.0(.2) (latest updates)
