# VertexArmor-Enclosure
VertexArmor are my newest SlimeVR Cases with better charging port location, easier internal layout (toolless assembly) and soon a dock too (Might require yoinking USB-C connectors from old/unused cables and some glue)

**Please note the cases are currently unfinished!**

Component support:
* BMI160
* Wemos D1 Mini
* 804040 Battery
* tp4056 type C charging board
* DPDT 2P2T power switch
* 24 or 26AWG wires (Thinner wires preferred for easier soldering/mounting)

For connecting the components, please refer to the SlimeVR documentation (https://docs.slimevr.dev/diy/tracker-schematics.html)

Made with Blender 3.6.1 / 4.0 (latest updates)

These cases are and will stay a W.I.P. for a little while.
